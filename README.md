MATLAB

The files in this repo are helpful for anyone working with image sensors and microcontrollers. It gets out the image data from the raw data available from the sensor.
In the two main converter programs, 'message' and 'question' are dialog boxes that I designed in the GUI builder. I have uploaded the .m files for these but not the .fig files.
